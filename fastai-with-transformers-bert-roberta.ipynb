    "## Introduction : Story of transfer learning in NLP\n",
    "In early 2018, Jeremy Howard (co-founder of fast.ai) and Sebastian Ruder introduced the  [Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1801.06146.pdf) (ULMFiT) method. ULMFiT was the first **Transfer Learning** method applied to NLP. As a result, besides significantly outperforming many state-of-the-art tasks, it allowed, with only 100 labeled examples, to match performances equivalent to models trained on 100×  more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time I heard about ULMFiT was during a [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=4) given by Jeremy Howard. He demonstrated how it was easy  -  thanks to the ``fastai`` library  -  to implement the complete ULMFit method with only a few lines of codes. In his demo, he used an AWD-LSTM neural network pre-trained on Wikitext-103 and get rapidly state-of-the-art results. He also explained key techniques - also demonstrated in ULMFiT - to fine-tune the models like **Discriminate Learning Rate**, **Gradual Unfreezing** or **Slanted Triangular Learning Rates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the introduction of ULMFiT, **Transfer Learning** became very popular in NLP and yet Google (BERT, Transformer-XL, XLNet), Facebook (RoBERTa, XLM) or even OpenAI (GPT, GPT-2) begin to pre-train their own model on very large corpora. This time, instead of using the AWD-LSTM neural network, they all used a more powerful architecture based on the Transformer (cf. [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these models are powerful, ``fastai`` do not integrate all of them. Fortunately, [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) 🤗 created the well know [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). Formerly knew as ``pytorch-transformers`` or ``pytorch-pretrained-bert``, this library brings together over 40 state-of-the-art pre-trained NLP models (BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, CTRL…). The implementation gives interesting additional utilities like tokenizer, optimizer or scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``transformers`` library can be self-sufficient but incorporating it within the ``fastai`` library provides simpler implementation compatible with powerful fastai tools like  **Discriminate Learning Rate**, **Gradual Unfreezing** or **Slanted Triangular Learning Rates**. The point here is to allow anyone — expert or non-expert — to get easily state-of-the-art results and to “make NLP uncool again”.\n",
    "\n",
    "It worth noting that the integration of the HuggingFace ``transformers`` library in ``fastai`` has already been demonstrated in:\n",
    "* Keita Kurita's article [A Tutorial to Fine-Tuning BERT with Fast AI](https://mlexplained.com/2019/05/13/a-tutorial-to-fine-tuning-bert-with-fast-ai/) which makes ``pytorch_pretrained_bert`` library compatible with ``fastai``.\n",
    "* Dev Sharma's article [Using RoBERTa with Fastai for NLP](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/using-roberta-with-fastai-for-nlp-7ed3fed21f6c) which makes ``pytorch_transformers`` library compatible with ``fastai``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these articles are of high quality, some part of their demonstration is not anymore compatible with the last version of ``transformers``.\n"

    "## 🛠 Integrating transformers with fastai for multiclass classification\n",
    "Before beginning the implementation, note that integrating ``transformers`` within ``fastai`` can be done in multiple different ways. For that reason, I decided to bring simple solutions, that are the most generic and flexible. More precisely, I try to make the minimum of modification in both libraries while making them compatible with the maximum amount of transformer architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in addition to this NoteBook and the [Medium article](https://medium.com/p/fastai-with-transformers-bert-roberta-xlnet-xlm-distilbert-4f41ee18ecb2?source=email-29c8f5cf1dc4--writer.postDistributed&sk=119c3e5d748b2827af3ea863faae6376), I made another version available on my GitHub(TODO add link)."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this NoteBook, I explain how to combine the ``transformers`` library with the beloved ``fastai`` library. It aims to make you understand where to look and modify both libraries to make them work together. Likely, it allows you to use **Slanted Triangular Learning Rates**, **Discriminate Learning Rate** and even **Gradual Unfreezing**. As a result, without even tunning the parameters, you can obtain rapidly state-of-the-art results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, the transformers became an essential tool to NLP. Because of that, I think that pre-trained transformers architectures will be integrated soon to future versions of fastai. Meanwhile, this tutorial is a good starter.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you enjoyed this first article and found it useful. \n",
    "Thanks for reading and don't hesitate in leaving questions or suggestions.\n"
